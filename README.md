# Azure-Based-Data-Pipeline

In this project my aim was to have a greater understanding of building a data pipeline from scratch given some requirements from fake stakeholders to expand my knowledge ready for any real world scenario. Building this pipeline I managed to have a lot more hands on experience with Azure and the intricate details for connecting every service from an on premise server all the way to building dashboards through powerbi. My biggest learning curve was the code put into it, developing the ETL and making sure everything ran smoothly. I think my biggest challenge in this project was using Azure services I had not learnt before, locating what I needed and exploring its full capabilities.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to extract customer and sales data from an on premise sql server, transform that data within the cloud creating a multi-hop architecture to make sure the data is aggregated and analytic ready. Finally the customer and sales data was then loaded and built into a dashboard to alleviate the current issue. Key vault was used during this project to ensure security and governance.
